# How to use the individual configuration file system:
#
# 1. Edit worlds.conf, and list the "worlds" (server instance names) and ports (and optionally, IPs)
#    for each Minecraft server instance you want to run.
# 2. Copy this file into the same directory as worlds.conf, and give it the name of the "world"
#    to which the file belongs. For example, if you have an instance that will be called "vanilla",
#    copy this file to "vanilla.conf".
# 3. Edit this file to suit, and don't forget to save your changes.
# 4. Repeat steps 2-4 for each additional server instance you list in worlds.conf.
# 5. Launch each server instance by running "/etc/init.d/minecraft_server watchstart <world>" from
#    a terminal window, and watch to make sure the script downloads and launches the server jar 
#    properly. If everything works correctly, edit the SERVER_CONFIG as desired to optimize the
#    server's operation.

# Server JAR file to use for this instance of a Minecraft server. If this differs from the name
# in the URL below, the file will be renamed to this after downloading.

# and your server may not run correctly - or at all!
