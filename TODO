Minecraft Server Control Script
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

The dreaded to-do list...

1. Solicit some folks to beat on this script and flesh out any errors, bugs, 
   misbehaviour, etc. (WebMaka's server setup won't be the only hard/software
   combo out there, so what works for him might not work well or at all for 
   anyone else.)
   
2. Build a workable web administration system that can call this script. It'll
   need to be able to reach the script in /etc/init.d from the Apache user
   (usually www-data), and obviously it'll have to reach into the server(s)
   (itself|themselves) to do things like show a list of players, show the server
   log' contents, etc. (This will probably need to be handled through the script
   so that everything's kept concise interface-wise.)
